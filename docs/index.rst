Welcome to RocketMAD's Documentation!
=========================================

RocketMAD gives you a live visualization map of nearby Pokémon, Pokéstops, Gyms, and much more in a form of a web-app as well as native phone application.
Used as `MAD's <https://github.com/Map-A-Droid/MAD>`_ frontend. Does not work as standalone and the code has been heavily modified to only work with MAD. This frontend is based on `RocketMap <https://github.com/RocketMap/RocketMap>`_.
